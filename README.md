#Switchboard Native

Just playing around with react-native constructing a Switchboard application.


#Make it work
You will need xcode installed.

run an `npm install`

There used to be a requirement to modify Cheerio but all is good now.

#Now it works?
If it doesn't work and you really want to contribute let me know and I can help you troubleshoot.
